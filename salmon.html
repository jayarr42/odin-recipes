        <h6>Some delicious salmon. Yum!</h6>
        <p>Making this delicious salmon is a breeze. It's the perfect meal to end the day with, 
            partly because it takes no effort at all! We'll start with ingredients.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 filets of salmon</li>
            <li>Large plastic zipper bag</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Lime Juice</li>
            <li>Dill</li>
        </ul>
<h3>Prep</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by patting dry the salmon</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce into the bag, enough that it will cover the salmon. 
                <em>Note: this will probably be less soy than you think!</em></li>
            <li>Add lime juice to the bag. <em>Note: this is less of a science 
                and more of an art. Add enough to turn the soy from black to brown color.</em></li>
            <li>Marinate the salmon in this mixture for a minimum of 30 minutes in the fridge. 
                <em>Note: some people say a short marinade is required for fish, I have not found this to be the case. 
                Letting it sit for up to 2 hours has been fine and only improved things.</em></li>
            <li>When you are ready to cook it, remove from the fridge, pat dry, and let reach approximately room temp</li>
            
        </ol>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>    
        <li>reheat the oven to 425</li>
            <li>Preheat a skillet to medium heat</li>
            <li>Oil your pan</li>
            <li>Place salmon skin side up in the skillet and cook for 4-4.5 minutes</li>
            <li>Place the skillet in the oven for 4-4.5 minutes</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
